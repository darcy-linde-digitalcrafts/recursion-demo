// The binary search problem involves finding the position of a target element
// within a sorted array. Binary search is a more efficient algorithm compared
// to linear search because it eliminates half of the remaining elements with
// each comparison, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity of O(log n).
//
// Assume the input array is sorted.
