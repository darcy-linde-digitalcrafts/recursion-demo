// The palindrome check problem involves determining whether a given string is a
// palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards as
// it does backwards. In other words, if you reverse a palindrome, it should
// still be the same as the original string.

const palindrome = (str) => {
  // base case
  // recursive case
};

export default palindrome;
